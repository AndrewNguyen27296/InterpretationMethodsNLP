If the outcome closer to 1, it denotes as positive class and negative class otherwise.

Firstly, it splits the data into different sets (same size, this time we put sets = 5). Secondly, it removes each feature to see how well model performs. Thirdly, with regularization techniques, it penalized the insignificant features.\n","- svc: SVM is a family of model classes that operate in high-dimensional space to find an\n","optimal hyperplane, where they attempt to separate the classes with the maximum margin\n","between them. Support vectors are the points closest to the decision boundary (the\n","dividing hyperplane) that would change it if were removed. To find the best hyperplane,\n","they use a cost function called hinge loss and a computationally cheap method to operate\n","in high-dimensional space, called the kernel trick, and even though a hyperplane suggests\n","linear separability, it's not always limited to a linear kernel. If probability=True, the scikit-learn\n","implementation uses cross-validation and then fits a logistic regression model to the SVC's\n","scores to produce the probabilities\n","- decision tree: its algorithm chooses the condition to split the branch of a tree, our example we have the tree depth of 7.\n","- knn: it chooses the most frequent labels. In our scenario, we use k=7\n","- naive bayes: it made assumptions that features are independent.\n","- gradient boosting: an ensemble method, which leverage boosting (in sequence). It trains weak model iteratively. In our case, we applied to decision tree with max_trees=210\n","- random forest: similar to decision tree, but it use multiple trees instead of only 1 tree, thus reduce the overfitting chance.\n","- mlp: it uses logistic function on the output layer, which produce prob between 0-1.
